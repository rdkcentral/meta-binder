# REFERENCE RECIPE - build the Binder SDK for a target image.
#
# Copy this into your own layer and adapt it. It is the recipe BUILD.md
# documents, kept here as a file so the guidance is something you can diff
# against rather than retype; tests/test_yocto_recipe_example.sh fails if the
# two disagree or if a required switch goes missing.
#
# It builds the target runtime libraries only. The AIDL compiler is a host tool
# the architecture team runs offline, and no target image carries it.

# No kernel dependency: this recipe STATES protocol 8 rather than reading it, so
# it never opens the kernel's .config and has no reason to wait for one. The
# dependency belongs with the derivation - binder-protocol-from-kernel.inc adds
# it, and only when it is actually deriving. Declaring it here would pull a
# kernel into the build for nothing, and fail outright where no kernel provider
# exists at all, such as an SDK build.

# Protocol 8, on every platform. It is what every 64-bit kernel serves, what
# every kernel from 4.18 serves, and what a 32-bit userspace runs perfectly well
# - it needs 64-bit FIELDS, not a 64-bit anything. Protocol 7 is legacy
# compatibility, for a 32-bit kernel at 4.17 or older that still carries
# CONFIG_ANDROID_BINDER_IPC_32BIT.
#
# The ELF class is NOT passed. It follows CC/CXX, which the toolchain already
# sets, and nothing in the build can change it - so declaring it would only
# restate what the compiler already says. Add -DTARGET_BITNESS=${SITEINFO_BITS}
# if you want the build to STOP when the toolchain is not the bitness this
# recipe is being built for; it is an assertion, not a setting.
#
# If your fleet still has protocol-7 platforms, or you want a kernel drifting
# back to protocol 7 to fail the BUILD rather than the device, derive it instead:
#
#     require binder-protocol-from-kernel.inc
#     EXTRA_OECMAKE += " -DBINDER_PROTOCOL=${BINDER_PROTOCOL_RESOLVED}"

# These libraries are UNVERSIONED - the SDK ships a plain libbinder.so, with no
# SONAME and no libbinder.so.1 beside it. That matters for packaging: OE's
# default -dev FILES claim ${libdir}/lib*.so, and -dev is ordered BEFORE ${PN}
# in PACKAGES, so -dev takes the real objects and do_package_qa rejects them:
#
#   QA Issue: -dev package libbinder-dev contains non-symlink .so
#             '/usr/lib/libbinder.so' [dev-elf]
#
# So -dev is ASSIGNED rather than appended, dropping the default .so glob. The
# runtime package keeps the libraries, which is correct - unversioned, they are
# the runtime artifact, not a development symlink. Consumers still link against
# them because do_populate_sysroot stages from ${D}, not from the -dev package.
